recursive functions have base cases and recursive steps

base cases return a value independent of recursive function calls to the same function

recursive steps return a value dependent on recursive function calls with altered parameter(s), closer to a base case

function call stack winds when recursive function pushes (adds) its contents (for example, local variables and function arguments) to the call stack as a stack frame

function call stack unwinds when recursive function returns its answer to the caller and pops (removes) its contents from the call stack
